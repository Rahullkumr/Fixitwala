## How to solve flutter 3.19 issue?
> took 15 hours to solve this

- error: not able to install `apk` on emulator because of `nix` new structures

- how I solved:
    - created new project in Project IDX and pushed to GitHub 
    - cloned both projects locally
    - deleted all files and folders from old project (i.e Fixitwala) except .git folder and lib folder
    - copy pasted all remaining files and folders from new project (i.e testfixitwala) 
    - pushed to GitHub 
    - imported freshly pushed Fixitwala project to Project IDX.
    - Finally it started working.
